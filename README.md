## Easily add dependencies to your Dart / Flutter project.

Pubspec Assist is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to easily add dependencies to your [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and [Flutter](https://www.flutter.io/) project's `pubspec.yaml`, all without leaving your editor.

## Download
[Download the latest version here.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeroen-meijer.pubspec-assist)

## Features

### Get the latest version for your packages.

**Pubspec Assist will get you the latest version of whatever package you are looking for** and puts it in your `pubspec.yaml` file while preserving comments and formats the file automatically.

### Never leave VS Code.

**Forget going to the Dart Pub site to search for your packages and copy the dependency text.**<br/>
You can look for and import packages directly from VS Code without ever switching windows.

### Smart (Fuzzy) search.

**Pubspec Assist is smart about finding what you're trying to search for.**<br>
It gets you the most likely package you want, and will give you a selection to choose from otherwise and **sorts them by relevance**.
